# Hi, I'm Oleg — Front-End & WordPress Developer 👋

I focus on clean, semantic code and seamless WordPress integration — no page builders, no bloat.

## 🔧 What I do
- Pixel-perfect HTML/CSS/JS layout from Figma or any design
- Mobile-first, responsive & accessible markup
- Custom WordPress themes (from scratch or starter themes)
- Integration of front-end into WordPress without Elementor/Divi
- Optimization, troubleshooting, and bug fixing for existing WP sites
- Plugin setup & lightweight customization

## 💼 Background
I’ve spent years working in a web agency under NDA, building production-ready websites — from simple landings to complex, multi-page structures. While most of that work is private, it shaped my professional habits and technical accuracy.

## 🚫 No Page Builders
I build custom WordPress solutions without relying on Elementor, Divi, or other visual editors — everything is done through clean, maintainable code.
